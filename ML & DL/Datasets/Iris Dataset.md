**Iris Dataset** is a well-known and widely used [[dataset]] in [[Machine Learning]] and [[statistics]]. It consists of measurements of various characteristics of three different species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica

The dataset contains 150 observations, with 50 observations for each species. For each observation, there are four features: the length and width of the sepals (the green leaf-like structures that surround the flower), and the length and width of the petals (the colorful part of the flower)

The iris dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for classification algorithms, and it has been used in many research papers, textbooks, and online tutorials. It was first introduced by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936, and it has since become a classic example in the field of machine learning
