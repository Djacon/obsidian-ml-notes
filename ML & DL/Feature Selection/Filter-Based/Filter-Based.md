**Filter-based methods**  are a class of [[feature selection]] techniques that use statistical measures to evaluate the relevance of each feature in the dataset. The term "filter" refers to the fact that these methods apply a filter to the data to select the most relevant features, independently of the chosen [[machine learning]] algorithm

Some common examples of filter-based methods are:

* Pearson Correlation
* Mutual Information
* Chi-Squared Test
* Variance Thresholding
