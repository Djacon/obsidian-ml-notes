**Wrapper-based methods** are a class of [[feature selection]] techniques that evaluate the performance of a [[machine learning]] algorithm on a subset of features and iteratively select the most relevant features based on their contribution to the model's accuracy. The term "wrapper" refers to the fact that these methods use the machine learning algorithm as a wrapper around the feature selection process

Some common examples of wrapper-based methods are:

* Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
* Forward Selection
* Backward Elimination
* Genetic Algorithms
