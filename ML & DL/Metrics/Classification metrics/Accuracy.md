**Accuracy** is a [[metric]] measured how often predictions equal labels. Accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness

#### Evaluation Function:
$$
Accuracy = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n[\hat y_i = y_i]
$$
