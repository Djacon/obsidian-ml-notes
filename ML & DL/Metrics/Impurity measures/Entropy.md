**Entropy** is an [[impurity measure]] used in [[decision tree]] algorithms to measure the randomness or impurity in a dataset. A value of 0 means all examples belong to the same class, while a value of 1 means the dataset is equally distributed among all classes

#### Evaluation Function

E = -\sum_{i=1}^np_i\log_2(p_i)
