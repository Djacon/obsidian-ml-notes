**Gini index** is a widely used [[impurity measure]] in [[decision tree]] algorithms. It measures the probability of misclassifying an example, with a value of 0 indicating perfect classification and a value of 1 indicating equal distribution among all classes

#### Evaluation Function
$$
Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^np(i)^2
