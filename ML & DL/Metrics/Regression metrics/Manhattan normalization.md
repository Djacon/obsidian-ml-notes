**Manhattan normalization (or Taxicab norm, $l_1$-distance)** is a [[metric]] whose usual distance function or metric of Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new metric in which the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates

#### Evaluation Function:
$$
||x||_1 := \sum_{i=1}^n|x_i|

\delta ||x||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^nsgn(x_i)
$$
