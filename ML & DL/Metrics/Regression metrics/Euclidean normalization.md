**Euclidean normalization** (or $l_2$-distance) is a [[metric]] in Euclidean geometry which gives the ordinary distance from the origin to the point X consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. This operation may also be referred to as SRSS, which is an acronym for the Square Root of the Sum of Squares

#### Evaluation Function:
$$
||x||_2 := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2}
$$

#### Derivative of a Function:
$$
\delta ||x||_2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2}}
$$
