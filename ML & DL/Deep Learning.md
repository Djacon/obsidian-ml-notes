**Deep Learning (DL)** - is a part of [[Machine Learning]] methods based on Artificial [[Neural Networks]] (ANN) with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised

Deep Learning architectures such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Deep [[Reinforcement Learning]] (Q-learning), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers have been applied to fields including [[Computer Vision]] (CV), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP), machine translation, bioinformatics, medical image analysis, climate science and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance
