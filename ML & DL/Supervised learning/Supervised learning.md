The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.

#### Supervised learning models:

1. Linear Models:
	1. [[Linear Regression]]
	2. [[Ridge]] (L2-regularization)
	3. [[Lasso]] (L1-regularization)
	4. [[Elastic-net]]
	5. [[SGDRegressor]]
	6. [[Logistic Regression]]
2. Tree-Based Models:
	1. Decision Tree Regressor
	2. Random Forest Regressor
	3. Gradient Boosting Regressor
	4. Extra Trees Regressor
	5. Ada Boost Regressor
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
	1. SVR
4. Naive Bayes:
	1. GaussianNB
	2. MultinomialNB
