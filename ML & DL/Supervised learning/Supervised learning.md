**Supervised learning (SL)** - is a field of [[machine learning]], that uses labeled inputs (meaning the input has a corresponding output label), given by a "teacher" and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs

#### Supervised learning models:

1. [[Linear Regressor]]
	1. [[Linear Regression]]
	2. [[Ridge]] (L2-regularization)
	3. [[Lasso]] (L1-regularization)
	4. [[Elastic-net]]
	5. [[SGDRegressor]]
	6. [[Logistic Regression]]
2. Tree-Based Models:
	1. DecisionTreeRegressor
	2. RandomForestRegressor
	3. GradientBoostingRegressor
	4. ExtraTreesRegressor
	5. AdaBoostRegressor
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
	1. SVR
	2. SVC
4. Naive Bayes:
	1. GaussianNB
	2. MultinomialNB
