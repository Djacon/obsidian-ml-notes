**Linear classifier** is a way to solve [[classification]] problems, where you need to divide data into classes. The class of problems that can be solved by linear classifiers has, respectively, the property of linear divisibility (the data can be separated by a straight line)

#### Prediction formula:
$$
y = sgn(w_0 + w_1x_1 +\ \dots\ + w_nx_n + \epsilon)
$$
