**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subdomain of [[computer science]] that focuses on [[algorithms]] which help  a computer learn from [[data]] without explicit programming to improve performance on some set of tasks. It's seen as part of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI)

#### Fields of Machine Learning:

* [[Supervised learning|Supervised learning (SL)]]
	* [[Classification]]
		* $Y = \{0,\ 1,\ 2,\ \dots \}$
	* [[Regression]]
		* $Y = \mathbb{R}$
* [[Unsupervised learning|Unsupervised learning (UL)]]
	* [[Clustering]]
	* [[Dimensionality reduction]]
* [[Reinforcement learning|Reinforcement learning (RL)]]
