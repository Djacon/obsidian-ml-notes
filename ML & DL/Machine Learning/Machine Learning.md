**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subdomain of [[computer science]] that focuses on [[algorithms]] which help  a computer learn from [[data]] without explicit programming to improve performance on some set of tasks. It's seen as part of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI)

#### The main fields of Machine Leaning:

* [[Supervised learning]] (SL)
	* [[Classification]]
		* $Y = \{0,\ 1,\ 2,\ \dots \}$
	* [[Regression]]
		* $Y = \mathbb{R}$
* [[Unsupervised learning]] (UL)
	* Clustering
	* [[Dimensionality reduction]]
* [[Reinforcement learning]] (RL)
