**Principle Component Analysis (PCA)** is a [[Dimensionality reduction]] of a dataset by finding the most important patterns in the data and representing them in a lower-dimensional space. It works by transforming the original data into a new coordinate system aligned with the principal axes of the data. By retaining only a subset of the principal axes, PCA can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important information. It is widely used in many fields, including data analysis, computer vision, and signal processing, for tasks such as feature extraction, data compression, and visualization of high-dimensional data
