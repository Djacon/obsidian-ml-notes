**Unsupervised learning (UL)** is a field of [[Machine Learning]], where is no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end

#### Unsupervised learning models:

1. Clustering
	1. K-Means
	2. AgglomerativeClustering
	3. Spectral Clustering
2. [[Dimensionality reduction]]
	1. [[Principle Component Analysis]] (PCA)
	2. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
