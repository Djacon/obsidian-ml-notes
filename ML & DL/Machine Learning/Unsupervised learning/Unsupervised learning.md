**Unsupervised learning (UL)** is a field of [[machine learning]], where is no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end

#### Unsupervised learning models:

* Clustering
	* K-Means
	* AgglomerativeClustering
	* Spectral Clustering
* [[Dimensionality reduction]]
	* [[Principle Component Analysis]] (PCA)
	* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
