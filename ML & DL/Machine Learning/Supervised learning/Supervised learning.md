**Supervised learning (SL)** is a field of [[Machine Learning]], that uses labeled inputs (meaning the input has a corresponding output label), given by a "teacher" and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs

#### Supervised learning models:

1. [[Linear Regressor]]
	1. [[Linear Regression]]
	2. [[Ridge]] (L2-regularization)
	3. [[Lasso]] (L1-regularization)
	4. [[Elastic-net]]
	5. [[SGDRegressor]]
	6. [[Logistic Regression]]
2. [[Decision Tree]]:
	1. [[DecisionTreeRegressor]]
	2. [[RandomForestRegressor]]
	3. GradientBoostingRegressor
	4. ExtraTreesRegressor
	5. AdaBoostRegressor
3. [[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM):
	1. [[Support Vector Regressor]] (SVR)
	2. [[Support Vector Classification]] (SVC)
4. [[Naive Bayes]]:
	1. [[GaussianNB]]
	2. MultinomialNB
