**Supervised learning (SL)** is a field of [[machine learning]], that uses labeled inputs (meaning the input has a corresponding output label), given by a "teacher" and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs

#### Supervised learning models:

* [[Linear Regressor]]
	* [[Linear Regression]]
	* [[Ridge]] (L2-regularization)
	* [[Lasso]] (L1-regularization)
	* [[Elastic-net]]
	* [[SGDRegressor]]
	* [[Logistic Regression]]
* [[Decision Tree]] / [[Ensemble]]:
	* [[DecisionTreeRegressor]]
	* [[RandomForestRegressor]]
	* GradientBoostingRegressor
	* ExtraTreesRegressor
	* AdaBoostRegressor
* [[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM):
	* [[Support Vector Regressor]] (SVR)
	* [[Support Vector Classification]] (SVC)
* [[Naive Bayes]]:
	* [[GaussianNB]]
	* MultinomialNB
