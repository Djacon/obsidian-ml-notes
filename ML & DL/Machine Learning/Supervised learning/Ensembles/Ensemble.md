**Ensemble** is a [[Machine Learning]] technique that combines multiple models to improve the overall performance of the system. The idea behind ensembles is to use multiple models that individually perform well, but may have different strengths and weaknesses, and combine their predictions to create a more robust and accurate final prediction
