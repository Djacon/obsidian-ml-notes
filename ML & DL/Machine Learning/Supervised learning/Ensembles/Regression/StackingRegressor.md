**StackingRegressor** is an [[ensemble]] learning method that combines multiple [[regression]] models by training a meta-classifier on their predictions. It works by training several base models on the training data, collecting their predictions on the validation data, and then using those predictions as inputs to train a final meta-classifier. The final meta-classifier then makes the ultimate prediction on new data
