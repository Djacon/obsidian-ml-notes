**Support Vector Machines (SVM)** is a [[Machine Learning]] algorithm used for [[Classification]], [[Regression]], and outlier detection. It works by finding the best decision boundary that can separate data points of different classes with maximum distance, which is called the margin. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and can handle non-linear decision boundaries by using kernel tricks
