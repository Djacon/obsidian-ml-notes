**Linear classifiers** are a type of machine learning [[Classification]] algorithm used for predicting the class of a given input. The basic idea behind these models is to use a linear function to separate the different classes

#### Prediction formula:
$$
y = f(w_0 + w_1x_1 +\ \dots\ + w_nx_n + \epsilon) = f(w\cdot x+\epsilon)
$$
