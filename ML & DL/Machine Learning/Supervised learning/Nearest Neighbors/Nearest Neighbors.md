**Nearest Neighbors** is a [[machine learning]] algorithm used for [[classification]] and [[regression]]. It's a type of instance-based learning where the model stores all available data and predicts new data based on their similarity to previously seen data

In the case of [[classification]], the algorithm predicts the class of a new data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. In the case of [[regression]], the algorithm predicts the output value of a new data point as the [[mean]] or [[median]] of the output values of its nearest neighbors

The term "nearest neighbors" refers to the closest data points to the new data point in the feature space, which are usually defined by a distance metric such as [[Euclidean distance]] or [[Manhattan distance]]
