**Pooling** is the process of downsampling and reducing the size of the feature matrix obtained after passing the image through the [[Convolution]] layer. In the Pooling layer, a filter is passed over the results of the previous layer and selects one number out of each group of values. Mostly used in [[convolutional neural network|CNNs]] and [[Computer Vision]]
