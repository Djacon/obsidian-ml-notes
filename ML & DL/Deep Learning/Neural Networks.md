**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),** usually simply called neural networks (NNs) or neuralnets, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain
