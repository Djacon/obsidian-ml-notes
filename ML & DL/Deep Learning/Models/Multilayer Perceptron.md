**Multilayer** **Perceptron** is a feedforward artificial [[Neural Network]] and is the most basic Deep Neural Network that consists of a series of fully connected **layers**. Using **Multilayer** **Perceptron** machine learning methods, we can overcome the need for high computing power required by modern Deep Learning architectures
