**VGG (Very Deep Convolution Neural Network)** is [[state of the art|SOTA]] [[Convolutional neural network|CNN network]] architecture, with multiple layers, that was designed to enhance classification accuracy by increasing the depth of the CNN. The “depth” refers to the number of convolution layers with VGG16 or VGG19 consisting of 16 and 19 convolution layers
