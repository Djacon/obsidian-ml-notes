**Deep Learning (DL)** Â is a subset of [[machine learning]] (ML) that learns features and tasks directly from [[data]]. Inputs are run through [[neural network]]. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised

#### Main Fields of Deep Learning:

* [[Computer Vision|Computer Vision (CV)]]
* [[Natural Language Processing|Natural Language Processing (NLP)]]
* Speech Processing (ASR/TTS)
* Recommendation Systems (RecSys)
* [[Large Language Model|Large Language Models (LLMs)]]
* Robotics (soon, i hope...)
