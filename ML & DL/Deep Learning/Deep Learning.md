**Deep Learning (DL)** Â is a subset of [[machine learning]] (ML) that learns features and tasks directly from [[data]]. Inputs are run through [[neural network]]. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised

#### Main Fields of Deep Learning:

* [[Computer Vision]]
* [[Natural Language Processing]]
* Speech Processing (ASR/TTS)
* Recommender Systems (RecSys)
* Robotics (soon, i hope...)

Deep Learning architectures such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Deep [[Reinforcement learning]] (Q-learning), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers have been applied to fields including [[Computer Vision]] (CV), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP), machine translation, bioinformatics, medical image analysis, climate science and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance
