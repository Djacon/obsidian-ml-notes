**Sigmoid** is a [[activation function]] with a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. It transforms any value in the domain $(−∞, ∞)$ to a number between 0 and 1


#### Evaluation Function:
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}
$$

#### Derivative of a Function:
$$
\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)\cdot(1-\sigma(z)) = \frac{e^{-z}}{(1+e^{-z})^2}
$$

#### Pros and Cons:
