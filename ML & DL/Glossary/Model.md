**Model** in [[machine learning]] is a [[math]] representation [[algorithms]] that can identify patterns or make predictions on unseen [[data]]. Unlike rule-based programs, these models don't have to be explicitly coded and can evolve over time as new data enters the system. It can be trained on a set of input data with their corresponding output values to make predictions or decisions on new data.  The choice of model depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data
