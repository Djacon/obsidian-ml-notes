**Gradient** is a vector that contains the partial derivatives of a function with respect to each of its input variables. For example, if we have a function $f(x, y)$, the gradient of this function would be a vector containing the partial derivative of f with respect to x and the partial derivative of f with respect to y, denoted by $âˆ‡f = [\frac{df}{dx}, \frac{df}{dy}]$
