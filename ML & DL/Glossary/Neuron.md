**Neuron** is a fundamental building block of artificial [[neural networks]], which are the backbone of [[deep learning]] (DL). In deep learning, a neuron is a [[math]] function that receives input signals from one or more other neurons, performs a computation on these signals, and then produces an output signal, which is passed on to other neurons
