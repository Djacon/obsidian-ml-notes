**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage [[data]] to improve performance on some set of tasks. It's seen as part of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI)

Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system:

#### The main fields of Machine Leaning:

* [[Supervised learning]] (SL)
	* [[Classification]]
		* $Y = \{0,\ 1\}^n$
	* [[Regression]]
		* $Y = \mathbb{R}$
* [[Unsupervied learning]]
	* Clustering
	* Dimensionalty Reduction
* [[Reinforcement learning]] (RL)
