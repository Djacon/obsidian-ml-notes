**Algorithm**, in [[math]] and [[computer science]], is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing

#### Fundamental Algorithms:

* Sorting Algorithms:
	* Bubble sort
	* Insertion / Selection / Merge sort
	* Radix / Quick sort / Timsort
* Shortest Path Algorithms:
	* [[Binary Search]]
	* Depth First Search / Breadth First Search (a.k.a. DFS/BFS)
* Dinamic Programming:
	* ...
