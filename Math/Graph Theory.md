**Graph theory** is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices ($V$) which are connected by edges ($E$)

### 1. Introduction

**Graph** is an ordered pair $G = (V, E)$, where $E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}$ 

* $V\ or\ V(G)$, a set of **vertices** (also called **nodes** or **points**)
* $E\ or\ E(G)$, a set of **edges** (also called **links** or **lines**), which are unordered pairs of vertices
* $|G| \coloneqq |V(G)|$ and $\lVert G \rVert \coloneqq |E(G)|$


* **Directed graph (digraph)** is a pair $(V, E)$, where $E \subseteq (V \times V)\ \textbackslash\ \{(v,\ v)\ |\ v \in V\}$
