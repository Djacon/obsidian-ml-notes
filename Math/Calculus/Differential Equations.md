**Differential Equations** is a branch of [[calculus]] that relates a function to its [[Derivative|derivatives]]. It describes how a function's rate of change is related to the function itself. In other words, it involves the [[derivative|derivatives]] of an unknown function and possibly the function itself

The general form of a differential equation is:

$$
F(x,y,\frac{dx}{dy}​,\frac{dx^2}{d^2y}​,\cdots)=0
$$
