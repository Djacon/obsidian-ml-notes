**Integral** is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operation of [[calculus]]. Integration started as a method to solve problems in [[math]] and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. Today integration is used in a wide variety of scientific fields

In general, the integral of a real-valued function $f(x)$ with respect to a real variable x on an interval $[a, b]$ is written as:
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\ dx
$$

When the limits are omitted, the integral is called an indefinite integral and is written as:
$$
\int f(x)\ dx
$$
