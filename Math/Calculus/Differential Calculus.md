**Differential Calculus** is a subfield of [[calculus]] that studies the rates at which quantities change. The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the [[derivative]] of a function, related notions such as the differential, and their applications. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value
