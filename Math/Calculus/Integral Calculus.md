**Integral Calculus** is one of the most important disciplines of a [[calculus]]. It can be viewed from different sides. For example, on the one hand, integration is the inverse operation of differentiation; on the other hand, the integral of a given function numerically determines the area/volume of a figure/body in the plane/space

The basic term in the theory of integral calculus is the term [[integral]], and the main task is to solve integrals and find ways to solve them
