**Set-Builder Notation** is a mathematical notation for describing a [[set]] by enumerating its elements, or stating the properties that its members must satisfy


**Set-Builder Notation example**:
* $Q = \{\frac{m}{n}\ |\ m,n \in Z,\ n \neq 0\}$
* $2Z = \{\dots,-4,-2,\ 0,\ 2,\ \dots \} = \{2n\ |\ n \in Z \}$
