**Ordered pairs $(a, b)$**, in [[set theory]], is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is different from the ordered pair $(b, a)$ unless $a = b$. (In contrast, the unordered pair {a, b} equals the unordered pair {b, a})

* An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is a set $\{\{a\},\ \{a,b\}\}$
