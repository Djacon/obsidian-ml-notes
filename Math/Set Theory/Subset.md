In mathematics, [[set]] $A$ is a **subset** of a set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$; $B$ is then a superset of $A$

* If **A** is a **subset** of **B**, then every element in A must also be in B ($A \subseteq B$)

Examples:
* $\{a,\ b\} \subseteq \{a,\ b,\ c\}$ (All elements in the set)
* $\{c,\ d\} \subseteq \{c,\ d\}$
* $\{a\} \not\subseteq \{\{a\}\}$ (The set has no element $a$)
* $\varnothing \subseteq \{x,\ y,\ z\}$ (Empty-set is included in any set)
