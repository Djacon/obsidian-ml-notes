**Power set (or Powerset)** of a set $S$ is the [[set]] of all subsets of $S$, including the empty set and $S$ itself. Any subset of $p(S)$ is called a family of sets over $S$


A **power set of A**, $p(A)$, is the set containing all possible subsets of A
* $A = \{a,\ b\},\ p(A) = \{\varnothing,\ \{a\},\ \{b\},\ \{a,\ b\}\}$

If $|A|$ = n, then $|p(A)| = 2^{|A|} = 2^n$

* $p(\varnothing) = 2^0 = 1$
* $p(\{\varnothing\}) = 2^1 = 2$
* $A \not\subseteq p(A)$, but $A \in p(A)$

If $|C| = k$ and $|D| = j$, then $|p(C \times D)| = 2^{|C|*|D|} = 2^{kj}$
