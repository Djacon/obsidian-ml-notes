**Set operations**Â is a concept similar to fundamental operations on numbers. There are four main set operations which include set union, set intersection, set complement, and set difference


The **complement** of A is written as $\bar A$
* $\bar A = \{a \in U\ |\ a \not\in A\}$

The **intersection** of A and B is
* $A \cap B = \{x\ |\ x \in A\ and\ x \in B\}$

The **union** of A and B is
* $A \cup B = \{x\ |\ x \in A\ or\ x \in B\}$

The **difference**, A-B, is defined as
* $A - B = \{x\ |\ x \in A\ and\ x \not\in B\}$

The **symmetric difference** (xor), $A \oplus B$ (or $A\ \triangle\ B$), is defined as
* $A\ \triangle\ B = (A-B) \cup (B-A)$
