**Measures of variability** are statistical indicators that describe the differences between individual values of the [[sample]]. They allow us to judge the degree of homogeneity of the obtained set, its compactness, and, indirectly, the reliability of the data obtained and the results derived from them.

##### Main measures of variability:
* [[Range]] - difference of maximum and minimum values
* [[Variance]] - average square of deviations of individual values of a feature from their mean value
* [[Standard deviation]] (std) - root of the variance, describe the deviation of values from their mean
