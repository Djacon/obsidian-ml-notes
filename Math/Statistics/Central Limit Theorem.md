**The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** establishes that, in many situations, for identically distributed independent [[sample|samples]], the standardized sample [[mean]] tends towards the standard [[normal distribution]] even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed

#### Math formula:
$$
Z = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(\frac{X_n-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}})
$$
