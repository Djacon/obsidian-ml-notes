**Data** is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted

### Types of Data (in [[statistics]]):

1. Quantitative - measured (numerical) values:
	1. Discrete (e.g.: 1, 2, 3, 4,...)
	2. Continuous (e.g.: $height \in (150, 200)$)
2. Qualitative (nominative/categorical):
	1. Nominal - aggregated values (e.g. Male = 1; Female = 2)
	2. Ordinal - operations of comparison
