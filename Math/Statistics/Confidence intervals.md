The **Confidence Interval (CI)** is the range of values that you expect your estimate to fall between a certain percentage of the time if you run your experiment again or re-sample the [[population]] in the same way

The **Standard Error (SE)** is the [[standard deviation]] (std) of its sampling distribution or an estimate of that standard deviation

$$
\sigma_x^- = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\ or \ se = \frac{std}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
