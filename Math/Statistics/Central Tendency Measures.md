**Central Tendency Measures** is a measure to describe a set of values by a single number, using various methods. For example, instead of listing salaries of all employees, they talk about the mean salary. There are many measures of central tendency; the final choice of measure is always left to the researcher

##### Main measures of central tendency:
* [[Mean]] is an average value in the sample
* [[Median]] is a number in the middle of an ordered dataset
