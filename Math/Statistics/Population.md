**Population** is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population
