**Sample** is the selection of a subset (a statistical sample) of individuals from within a statistical [[population]] to estimate characteristics of the whole population


##### There are 3 types of Sampling:
1. **Simple random sample** (SRS, We select random values from the whole sample)
2. **Stratified sample** (We divide the sample into groups and take random values from each)
3. **Cluster sample** (We divide the sample into clusters, select only some of them, and take random values from there)
