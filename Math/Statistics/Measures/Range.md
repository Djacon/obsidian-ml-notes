**Range (Размах)** of a [[sample]] is the difference between the largest and smallest values. It is expressed in the same units as the [[data]]. Range is the size of the smallest interval which contains all the data and provides an indication of [[statistics|statistical]] [[variance|dispersion]]

#### Math formula:
$$
R = X_{max} - X_{min}
$$


#### Function implementation:

```python
# Build-in method
R = max(sample) - min(sample)
```
