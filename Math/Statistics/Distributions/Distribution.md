**Distribution** is a [[statistics]] term used to describe the pattern of values or observations that a variable can take on in a [[population]] or [[sample]]. It provides information about how frequently each possible value or range of values occurs for a particular variable. A distribution can be represented graphically using histograms, frequency polygons, or other graphical tools, which allow for a visual representation of the distribution's shape, center, and spread / [calculator](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/)
