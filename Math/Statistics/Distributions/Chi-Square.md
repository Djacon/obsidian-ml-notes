**Chi-Square Distribution** is a probability [[distribution]] that is used in [[statistics]] to test the independence of two categorical variables. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether there is a significant association between two variables

#### Math formula:
$$
\chi^2=\sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$
where:
* $O_i$ - Observed value
* $E_i$ - Expected value
