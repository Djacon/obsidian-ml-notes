**Normal distribution (Gaussian distribution)** is a type of continuous probability distribution for real-valued variable. The general form of its **probability density function** (PDF) is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(\frac{x-\mu}{4\sigma})^2}
$$

**Standardization** ([[Z-normalization]])Â refers to the process of normalizing every value in a dataset such that the mean of all of the values is 0 ($M_z = 0$) and the standard deviation is 1 ($\sigma_z = 1$)

$$
Z = \frac{X-M_x}{\sigma_x} \ or\ Z_n = \frac{\bar X_n-M_x}{\sigma_x/\sqrt{n}}
$$
